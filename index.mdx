# Daily Coding Challenge

I'm using this repo/website as a personal space to "challenge" myself every now and then. Even though it says _Daily Coding Challenge_ there won't be daily updates, just every now and then.

Please also keep in mind, that the solutions are far away from perfect. Some of them were made while waiting for a friend, other during travel in public transport or similar.

I found a lot of the problems at this awesome [website](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/). I just can recommend checking it out. I'm trying to write the source of all the other after the description of the affected problem.

So lets start happy hacking ðŸ˜‰
