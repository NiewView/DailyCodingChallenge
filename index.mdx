# Read Me

I'm using this repo/website as a personal space to "challenge" myself every now and then. Even though it says *Daily Coding Challenge* there won't be any daily updates, just every now and then.

Please also keep in mind, that the solutions are far away from perfect. Some of them were made while waiting for a friend, other during travel in public transport or similar. 

I found a lot of them at this awesome [website](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/). I just can recommend checking it out. I'm trying to write the source of all the other after the description.

So lets start happy hacking ;-)
