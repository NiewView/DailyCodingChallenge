# Add to sum

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and k of 17, return true since `10 + 7` is 17.

**Bonus**: Can you do this in one pass?

```typescript
export const findFirstMissingPositiveInteger = (
  inputArr: number[],
): number => {
  let set = new Set(inputArr);
  console.log(set)
  for (let i = 1; i < inputArr.length+1; i++) {
    if(!set.has(i)){
      return i;
    }
  }
  throw new Error("an unkown error occured");
};

```
